# Python Learning - Data Structures

## Overview
This module covers Python's built-in data structures, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, along with their operations and use cases.

## Lessons

### Lesson 2.1: Lists and Tuples
- Lists (mutable sequences)
- Tuples (immutable sequences)
- Common operations
- Slicing and indexing
- List methods

### Lesson 2.2: Dictionaries and Sets
- Dictionaries (key-value pairs)
- Sets (unique collections)
- Common operations
- Dictionary methods
- Set operations

### Lesson 2.3: Task Manager Data v1
- Using dictionaries for structured data
- Lists of dictionaries
- Data manipulation
- Basic task management with structured data

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Python's built-in data structures
- Learn how to manipulate and access data
- Master common operations and methods
- Build a more structured task manager

## Key Differences from Java
- Lists are like ArrayList but more flexible
- Tuples are immutable lists
- Dictionaries are like HashMaps but more flexible
- Sets are like HashSet but with more operations
- Negative indexing
- Slicing syntax
- List and dictionary comprehensions

## Prerequisites
- Completed Python Basics module
- Understanding of basic programming concepts
- Familiarity with Python syntax

## Next Steps
After completing this module, proceed to Functions and Modularity to learn about Python functions and code organization.
