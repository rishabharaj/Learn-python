# Python Learning - Object-Oriented Programming in Python

## Overview
This module covers object-oriented programming concepts in Python, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Lessons

### Lesson 4.1: Classes and Objects
- Class definition
- Object instantiation
- Instance variables
- Methods
- Special methods

### Lesson 4.2: Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Single inheritance
- Method overriding
- super() function
- Abstract base classes
- Duck typing

### Lesson 4.3: Task Manager OOP v3
- Object-oriented task management
- Class-based design
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Python's OOP features
- Learn about classes and objects
- Master inheritance and polymorphism
- Build an object-oriented task manager

## Key Differences from Java
- No access modifiers (public, private, protected)
- No method overloading
- self parameter in methods
- Special methods (__init__, __str__, etc.)
- Properties and descriptors
- Multiple inheritance is allowed
- No interfaces (use abstract base classes)
- Duck typing instead of interface implementation
- super() is more flexible
- No abstract keyword

## Prerequisites
- Completed Functions and Modularity module
- Understanding of basic OOP concepts
- Familiarity with Python functions

## Next Steps
After completing this module, proceed to File I/O to learn about file operations in Python.
