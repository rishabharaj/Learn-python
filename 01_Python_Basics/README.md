# Python Learning - Python Basics

## Overview
This module covers the fundamental concepts of Python programming, including syntax, variables, operators, and control flow structures.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1.1: Syntax, Variables & Types
- Python's indentation-based syntax
- Variable assignment and dynamic typing
- Basic built-in types
- Type checking and conversion

### Lesson 1.2: Operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Assignment operators
- Membership and identity operators

### Lesson 1.3: Control Flow - Conditionals
- if, elif, else statements
- Truthiness in Python
- Nested conditionals
- Ternary operator

### Lesson 1.4: Control Flow - Loops
- for loops
- while loops
- break and continue
- else clause in loops
- range() function

### Lesson 1.5: Basic I/O & Task Manager v0
- Basic input/output operations
- String formatting
- Simple task management
- Basic program structure

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Python's syntax and basic structure
- Learn about variables and data types
- Master control flow statements
- Build a simple task manager application

## Key Differences from Java
- No semicolons needed
- No braces for blocks (uses indentation)
- Dynamic typing (no type declarations)
- No need for main() method
- Different loop syntax
- Simpler I/O operations

## Prerequisites
- Completed Setup and Introduction module
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Python environment set up

## Next Steps
After completing this module, proceed to Data Structures to learn about Python's built-in data structures.
